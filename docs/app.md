# Workout Tracker App

## Overview

This workout tracker app allows users to follow a consistent, progressive training program by automatically managing rep counts and weight adjustments. It starts with two predefined workouts (Push and Pull), each composed of multiple exercises. Every exercise contains sets, and each set records the number of reps and the weight used.

Workouts begin at a minimum of 8 reps per set. If the user successfully completes all reps in a session, the next workout increases each set by 1 rep, up to a maximum of 12 reps. Upon reaching 12 reps, the rep count resets to 8, and the app calculates a new weight so the user continues to progress in total volume and load.
